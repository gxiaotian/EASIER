# This file lists the dependencies required for development.
#
# This file contains extra dependencies for unit testing and functional test
# than the minimum requirements for runtime.
#
# To ensure the consistency of development activities, it's recommended to
# specify the exact version of a dependency,
# rather than specifying a range of versions, especially for those dependencies
# whose interfaces are in rapid evolution.
#
# However, the version of Python itself isn't specified here but it should be
# fixed to Python 3.8.
#
#
# To setup the environment:
#
#   sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev
#
#   pip install Cython mpi4py                   # see below
#   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

# WARNING
# mgmetis wrongly specifies Cython a "install time" requirement and mpi4py
# as optional but they should both be "setup time" requirements.
# Therefore we need to install them separatedly before
# `pip install mgmetis` or `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`
# so that ParMETIS support can be added.
